# Unweighted Graph Representation

This assignment parses data from a .txt file, and creates an undirected graph matrix. The graph is an unweighted representation of the data. Patterns are visable by comparing vertical lines, where each line [l] represents a unique entity ID.

The data is minified to (~150 lines) upon start to reduce loading time.
